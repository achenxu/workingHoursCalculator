Working Hours Calculator
================

A database backed, light-wight Meteor web app that calculates wages of employees based on their working hours. A .csv-file is parsed that contains work shifts of a company's employees. Data along with the result is stored in the DB and shown on a beautiful bootstrap based front-end.
